            Timber-frame buildings are found all over the China and are a unique symbol of Chinese architectural culture. Wooden components such as columns, beams, purlins, lintels, arches, etc. are connected by mortise and tenon joints, which are flexible and earthquake-resistant. 
            By assembling pre-fabricated components, a sturdy frame can be quickly installed at the building site. In addition to structural carpentry, the building process includes decorative carpentry, tile roofing, stonework, decorative painting, and other arts taught orally and practically by masters and apprentices.

Society.
            For the carpenters and craftsmen who have preserved this style of architecture, and for the people who have lived in the spaces it defines for generations, it has become a central visual component of Chinese identity and an important representation of Asian architecture.
