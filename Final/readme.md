I designed a cartoon style website to introduce the characteristics of Beijing. The webpage is divided into three parts: Places, Foods and Music. Places is a small program that allows you to randomize destinations, foods is a program that allows you to make roast ducks step by step, and music is a player that allows you to enjoy Peking Opera.

I'd like to share part of the code for the Roast Duck, where I put the images of the different stages of the duck in an array and control exactly which image is displayed via currentStep. I started to struggle with whether to then display the components of the pancake individually or follow the steps in a Photoshop collage. I wanted the viewer to be able to click on the appropriate buttons in order, so I chose to do the image editing in order with Photoshop and then disable the buttons already in used with js.

I originally wanted to arrange the buttons and other elements irregularly on the interface, but after many trials I didn't think it was very harmonious and ended up arranging the buttons more regularly.

I consolidated what I learned in class and became more proficient in completing projects. I felt the need to test myself while writing my own JS to make the logic clearer. In addition, I have a sense of overall planning and have become more efficient compared to midterm.

I hope that more information about the food can be presented on the website, and that more interactive mini-games can be developed to make the viewer experience more interesting.

### I have all my psd works in "others" folder.
